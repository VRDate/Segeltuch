<p>I have a couple files I wish to share so I will post them on this page.  You may post local
copies of any files on this page except for the ones explicitely state you can not!  Thank you.

  <li><a href="segeltuch-0.3.4-win32.zip">Segeltuch Main Distribution</a><br>
      The main executable for Segeltuch, the interactive POF editor.  This is version 0.3.4, and
      includes the ability to edit weapons and special points.  E-mail me if you need earlier versions.
  <li><a href="segeltuch-0.3.4-src.zip">Segeltuch Source Code</a>(SOON!)<br>
      The source code will be released under the GPL as soon as I have verified that all the code
      is OK to go.  Mind you, this code is pretty nasty to look at and <i>requires</i> Borland
      C++Builder5 to compile.  However, a lot of modules are basic STL C++, so you can still 
      nab some pieces (within the GPL that is :-).
  <LI><A href="pof2cob-0.9-win32.zip">FreeSpace2 POF to trueSpace COB Converter v0.9</A><br>
      I think the title says it all.  This is for all the animators out there.  This app is less
      useful for actually editing models.
