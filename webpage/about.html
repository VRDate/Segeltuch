<p>Segeltuch is a 3-dimensional, hierarchy based modeler dedicated to the creation of models
for the game FreeSpace 2 by Volition, Inc.

<p>It has been under development for some time now due to the relaxed priority that I have
given it.  Though I may work on it less from time to time, coding has not and will not
ever stop.  The code-base that I am developing with each new version of this application is
important for future applications.  This means that Segeltuch will probably be the first in
line of many gaming editors.  But let us not get too far ahead of ourselves.  The first public
release of Segeltuch took place on Oct. 5, 2000.  We'll see what kind of future it has.
